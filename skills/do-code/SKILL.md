# Implement a Code Change

Wraps implementation work in a Maverick skill so the workflow report
records what was done and the agent applies the project's coding
standards before editing. Invoke this skill **once per task** from
inside `do-issue-solo` / `do-issue-guided` /
`do-epic` Phase 5. The argument is a one-line task
description that gets logged in the report.

This skill is a thin wrapper. The actual edits are made by the
orchestrating Claude Code session using its built-in tools (Read, Edit,
Write, Bash, Grep). The skill's job is to pin standards and scope, not
to perform the edits in a subagent.

## Project rules (mandatory)

Before doing anything else, check for repo-specific coding guidance at
`docs/maverick/skills/do-code/SKILL.md` (path relative to the repo root).

- **If the file exists**, read it fully and treat its contents as
  binding for this task. It holds project-specific rules that all
  Maverick coding in this repo must follow. Where it conflicts with
  generic guidance below, the project file wins.
- **If the file is absent**, continue without it. Do not create or
  scaffold the file as part of this task.

## Preflight (mandatory)

Run this **first**. If it exits non-zero, halt and report the stderr
output to the user verbatim. Do not proceed.

```bash
uv run maverick preflight do-code
```

Skip the preflight when invoked from inside a `do-issue-*` or
`do-epic` phase — the orchestrator already ran a stricter one this
session. Run it only when this skill is invoked standalone.

The check verifies the project is initialised and `uv` is on PATH.

## Standards to apply

Before editing, read and follow:

- `mav-scope-boundaries` — implement only what `$ARGUMENTS`
  asks for. No unrelated cleanup, no opportunistic refactors, no
  abstractions for hypothetical future requirements. Three similar
  lines is better than a premature abstraction.
- `mav-bp-error-handling` — error handling at system
  boundaries only (user input, external APIs). Don't catch what
  framework guarantees rule out. No defensive code for scenarios that
  can't happen.
- `mav-bp-operability` — log levels, structured fields, and
  the project's logging conventions.
- `mav-bp-application-security` — input validation, secret
  handling, authn/authz patterns. If the change touches any of these,
  surface the design choice in your verification.

Also read **any project-level skills** at `docs/maverick/skills/` —
topic-specific guidance for this codebase that supplements the
maverick-wide best practices.

## Implementation loop

1. **Read before writing.** Open the files you're about to change.
   Grep for existing patterns nearby — the goal is for the edit to
   look like it was written by whoever wrote the surrounding code.
2. **Make the change.** Smallest diff that satisfies the task. If you
   notice an unrelated bug or a tempting refactor, **do not fix it**
   in this skill — write it down for a follow-up.
3. **Verify** per `mav-local-verification` (lint,
   typecheck, tests). Run the project's verification commands.
4. **If verification fails**, diagnose per
   `mav-systematic-debugging` and fix. Do not paper over
   a failing test or silence a lint warning. Do not commit red.
5. **Return** when (a) the task is done and (b) verification is green.

## Rules

- **Default to no comments.** Identifiers carry the WHAT. Only add a
  comment when the WHY is non-obvious (hidden constraint, subtle
  invariant, workaround for a specific bug). No "removed X" /
  "added Y" / "used by Z" comments — those rot.
- **No half-finished implementations.** If the task can't be completed
  cleanly, halt and report rather than leaving partial state.
- **No unauthorised destructive actions.** Don't `git push --force`,
  `git reset --hard`, `rm -rf`, drop tables, or delete data. If the
  task description doesn't explicitly authorise a destructive step,
  treat it as out of scope and ask.
- **Tests are part of the change.** If the change is testable, write
  or update tests in the same task (or wrap that work in
  `do-test` as a sibling call before the commit).
- **Stay inside the task envelope.** When `$ARGUMENTS` is
  ambiguous, ask for clarification rather than guess.

## Return Protocol

`do-code` is a **subroutine of the calling workflow's
per-task loop** — not a terminal action. Returning from this skill is a
hand-back to the caller's next numbered step, not a completion event
(#106).

When you return from this skill, **do not** post a closing summary, do
not stop, do not treat verification-green as "task done." The calling
workflow's loop still owns, in order:

1. Closing the `skill-dispatch` interval that wrapped this invocation
   (`uv run maverick report end skill-dispatch … --outcome success`).
2. Optionally sibling-calling `do-test` for tests that
   weren't folded into this skill.
3. Conventional commit referencing the issue number, then push (with
   stacked-PR retarget if applicable).
4. Logging the commit row to the workflow report
   (`uv run maverick report commit …`).
5. Updating the tasks comment / closing the sub-issue.
6. Heartbeat refresh.

If you find yourself drafting a final summary after returning here,
that is the signal: scroll back to the calling workflow's per-task
loop and resume from the step immediately after the
`/do-code` invocation.
