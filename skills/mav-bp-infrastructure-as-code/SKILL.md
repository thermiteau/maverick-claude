# Infrastructure as Code Standards

All infrastructure must be defined, versioned, and reproducible from code; manual provisioning is a last resort and must be documented in a runbook.

## Maverick's Rules

- **Never auto-apply destructive changes** — resource deletion or replacement requires human review before apply. CI follows validate → plan → review → apply; post the plan output to the pull request.
- **One provisioning tool per resource layer** — do not mix (e.g.) Terraform and CloudFormation for the same resources.
- **Secrets never in IaC files** — no credentials in definitions or variable files (including `.tfvars`); reference a secret manager with dynamic injection at deploy time, and mark secret outputs as sensitive.
- **State handling** — remote backend with locking, state isolated per environment, never committed to the repository, never hand-edited (use the tool's state commands). Treat state files as sensitive.
- **Environment parity** — one set of templates parameterised per environment; no separate per-env template copies. Promote dev → staging → prod; run regular plan/diff for drift detection.
- **Traceability** — tag every resource (service, environment, owner, commit SHA); the CI apply identity has limited, audited permissions.
- **Runbook fallback** — any unavoidable manual step gets a runbook stored alongside IaC (e.g., `docs/runbooks/`), including prerequisites, verifiable numbered steps, verification, rollback, owner, and whether it is temporary or should be migrated to IaC. Review runbooks like code.
- **IaC is versioned with application code** and follows the same review/merge process. Container orchestration definitions (Helm, Kustomize, manifests) are IaC too.

## Project Implementation Lookup

Check for `docs/maverick/skills/infrastructure-as-code/SKILL.md`. If present, read it and follow it — it wins on specifics (library, config, conventions). If missing, proceed with these standards and note the gap in your summary.

## Detecting IaC Issues in Code Review

| Pattern                                        | Issue                          | Fix                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Hard-coded secret in IaC file                  | Secret exposure                | Move to secret manager, reference dynamically        |
| Copy-pasted templates per environment          | Environment drift risk         | Parameterise a single template                       |
| State file committed to repository             | State corruption risk          | Move to remote backend with locking                  |
| No plan step in CI pipeline                    | Blind apply                    | Add plan stage, require review before apply          |
| Manual infrastructure change with no runbook   | Undocumented, unreproducible   | Write a runbook or convert to IaC                    |
| Resources with no tags or labels               | Untrackable resources          | Add standard tags (service, environment, owner, SHA) |
| Destructive changes auto-applied               | Accidental data loss           | Require human approval for destroy/replace actions   |
| Mixed IaC tools for the same resource layer    | Conflicting state management   | Standardise on one tool per layer                    |
