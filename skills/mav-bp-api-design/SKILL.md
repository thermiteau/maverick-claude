# API Design Standards

Ensure all APIs (REST, GraphQL, or any other surface) are consistent, predictable, documented as code, and backwards compatible by default.

## Maverick's Rules

- **Backwards compatible by default** — additions are safe; removing/renaming fields, changing types or semantics, making optional fields required, changing URL structure, or removing endpoints requires a version bump. Support at minimum the current and previous version. Deprecate before removal: mark in the spec, send `Deprecation`/`Sunset` headers, log usage, communicate a timeline, remove only at zero usage.
- **One versioning strategy per project** (URL path or Accept header), applied consistently; increment only for breaking changes.
- **Consistent error envelope on every error**: machine-readable `code` (a string constant, not the HTTP status), user-safe `message`, optional field-level `details`, and a `correlationId`. Never expose stack traces, internal paths, or implementation details.
- **Documentation generated from source** — OpenAPI generated from or validated against code; GraphQL via introspection. Never a separately maintained wiki (it drifts). Include examples, auth requirements, rate limits, and error codes.
- **Pagination on every list endpoint** — cursor-based preferred (opaque cursors, `cursor` + `limit` params, documented maximum); offset-based only for small, stable datasets needing random page access.
- **Rate limiting on all public endpoints** — return `429`, include `X-RateLimit-*` and `Retry-After` headers, apply per-tier limits, document them.
- **Idempotency**: `PUT`/`DELETE` idempotent by design; `POST` operations that must be idempotent (e.g., payments) require an `Idempotency-Key` header with cached-response replay and a TTL. Document which endpoints support it.
- **Validate at the boundary** before business logic runs; reject unexpected fields rather than silently ignoring them; enforce size limits. See `mav-bp-application-security`.
- **GraphQL specifics**: fields non-nullable by default (nullable only when absence is a valid state); enforce query depth/complexity limits; DataLoader or equivalent for N+1 prevention; persisted queries in production where possible.

## Project Implementation Lookup

Check for `docs/maverick/skills/api-design/SKILL.md`. If present, read it and follow it — it wins on specifics (library, config, conventions). If missing, proceed with these standards and note the gap in your summary.

## Detecting API Issues in Code Review

When reviewing code, flag these patterns:

| Pattern                                            | Issue                              | Fix                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Verbs in URL paths (`/getUser`, `/createOrder`)    | REST anti-pattern                  | Use nouns with HTTP methods                            |
| `200 OK` returned for error conditions             | Incorrect status code              | Use appropriate 4xx/5xx codes                          |
| No input validation on request handlers            | Security and data integrity risk   | Validate at the boundary                               |
| Stack traces or internal paths in error responses  | Information disclosure             | Use standard error format, log details server-side     |
| Inconsistent field naming (camelCase vs snake_case)| Breaks predictability              | Pick one convention and apply everywhere               |
| Missing pagination on list endpoints               | Performance risk at scale          | Add cursor or offset pagination                        |
| Breaking change without version bump               | Backwards compatibility violation  | Bump version or make the change additive               |
| No rate limiting on public endpoints               | Abuse and availability risk        | Implement rate limiting with appropriate headers       |
| No idempotency on payment/financial endpoints      | Duplicate processing risk          | Require idempotency keys                               |
| API docs maintained separately from code           | Documentation drift                | Generate docs from source (OpenAPI, introspection)     |
