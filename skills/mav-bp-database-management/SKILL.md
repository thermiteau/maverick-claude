# Database & Data Management Standards

Maverick's hard rules for schema migrations, environment isolation, and data safety.

## Maverick's Rules

- **Forward-only in production** — never roll back a production migration manually; undo with a new forward migration.
- **Every migration is reversible** — each migration includes an up and a down operation, even if the down is only ever used in development.
- **Never edit an already-applied migration** — once applied to any shared environment, write a new migration instead.
- **No ad-hoc DDL against shared environments** — every schema change is a versioned migration file in version control.
- **Strict environment isolation** — dev, staging, and production databases are completely separate. Never connect to production from a local machine (bastion/audited admin tools only). Never copy production data to development — seed data or anonymised snapshots only.
- **Seed data is synthetic and idempotent** — never production data in seed files; re-running seeds produces the same result.
- **No speculative indexes** — index only columns appearing in actual query `WHERE`/`JOIN`/`ORDER BY`/`GROUP BY` clauses; remove unused indexes.
- **Connection pooling is mandatory** — never open a connection per request; configure connection and idle timeouts.
- **Stage destructive schema changes** — `DROP`/`RENAME`/type changes require the expand-backfill-contract pattern: deploy code that stops using the column first, then migrate.

## Project Implementation Lookup

Check for `docs/maverick/skills/database-management/SKILL.md`. If present, read it — it wins on specifics (library, config, conventions). If missing, proceed with these standards and note the gap in your summary.

## Detecting Database Issues in Code Review

When reviewing code, flag these patterns:

| Pattern                                            | Issue                              | Fix                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Raw SQL without parameterised queries              | SQL injection risk                 | Use parameterised queries or ORM                       |
| Manual schema change (ad-hoc DDL)                  | Unreproducible, untracked change   | Create a migration file                                |
| Editing an already-applied migration               | Breaks migration history           | Write a new migration                                  |
| No index on columns used in WHERE/JOIN             | Performance degradation at scale   | Add appropriate index                                  |
| Opening connection per request (no pooling)        | Connection exhaustion              | Use connection pool                                    |
| Hardcoded connection string                        | Security risk, environment coupling| Use environment variables or secrets manager            |
| Missing down migration                             | Cannot revert in development       | Add reversible down operation                          |
| Production data in seed files                      | Data leak, privacy violation       | Use synthetic data only                                |
| `DROP TABLE` or `DROP COLUMN` without staged rollout| Breaks running application        | Stage the change: remove code references first         |
| No transaction wrapping for multi-step migration   | Partial application on failure     | Wrap in transaction where the database supports it     |
